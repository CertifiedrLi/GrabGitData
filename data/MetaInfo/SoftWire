  "description": "SoftWire is a class library written in object-oriented C++ for compiling assembly code.  It can be used in projects to generate x86 machine code at run-time as an alternative to self-modifying code.  Scripting languages might also benefit by using SoftWire as a JIT-compiler back-end.  It also allows to eliminate jumps for variables which are temporarily constant during run-time,  like for efficient graphics processing by constructing an optimised pipeline.  Because of its possibility for 'instruction rewiring' by run-time conditional compilation,  I named it \"SoftWire\".  It is targeted only at developers with a good knowledge of C++ and x86 assembly.  Project originally by Nicolas Capens, new implementation by Simone Margaritelli aka evilsocket",
