  "description": "Lipi Toolkit (LipiTk) is an open source toolkit for online Handwriting  Recognition (HWR), supported on Windows as well as Linux, created and  maintained by HP Labs India.  In its present version, the toolkit contains generic algorithms for the recognition of isolated handwritten shapes such as pen gestures and handwritten characters, captured using a stylus or electronic pen or finger, using devices such as TabletPCs, PDAs, stylus-equipped SmartPhones, external tablets, notes taking devices, digital pen and paper, to name some common ones.  In addition to supporting the creation of new recognizers for arbitrary sets of shapes and new scripts, LipiTk also contains ready-to-use recognizers for common character sets, standalone demos and pen-based applications, as well as standalone tools for data collection and annotation. In addition, on this site, you will also find project ideas, and resources related to online handwriting recognition.  For more information, please refer to the Overview and the FAQ sections.",
