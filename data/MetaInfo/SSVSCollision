  "description": "[HEADER-ONLY] C++11 AABB simple collision detection/response framework for games. Depends on SSVStart, SFML2.0. It has nice performance. Features interchangeable spatial partitioning and resolution systems, a way to prevent the \"crack problem\", easy to use C++11 lambda callbacks for collision events. It's not perfect, but it should work very well for any simple 2D game.",
